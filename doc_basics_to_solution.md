**Chapter 1: Introduction to Code Classification and Deep Learning**

**1.1 The Task of Code Classification**

Code classification is a fundamental problem in software engineering and computer science. It involves automatically assigning labels to code files based on their programming language or functionality. This capability has numerous applications, including:

- **Code Search and Retrieval:** Efficiently searching and retrieving relevant code snippets from large repositories.
- **Software Engineering Analytics:** Understanding the composition of software projects, identifying code dependencies, and analyzing code quality.
- **Automated Code Documentation:** Generating documentation or summaries for code files.
- **Bug Detection and Prediction:** Identifying potential vulnerabilities or errors based on code patterns.
- **Code Translation:** Translating code from one programming language to another.

**1.2 Deep Learning for Text Classification**

Deep learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for text classification, surpassing traditional machine learning techniques in many scenarios. Deep learning models, particularly those based on the Transformer architecture, excel at learning complex patterns and representations from text data.

**1.2.1 Neural Networks: The Building Blocks**

Neural networks are the foundation of deep learning. They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized in layers. Each connection between neurons has a weight associated with it, representing the strength of the connection.

- **Input Layer:** Receives the input data (e.g., a numerical representation of a code file).
- **Hidden Layers:** Perform computations on the input, extracting features and learning hierarchical representations.
- **Output Layer:** Produces the final classification output (e.g., the probability of a code file belonging to each programming language).

**1.2.2 Training Neural Networks**

Training a neural network involves adjusting the connection weights to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual label. This is achieved through:

- **Loss Function:** Measures the error between predictions and true labels (e.g., cross-entropy loss).
- **Optimizer:** An algorithm that updates the weights based on the loss (e.g., Adam, SGD).
- **Backpropagation:** An algorithm for efficiently computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights.
- **Gradient Descent:** An iterative optimization algorithm that adjusts the weights in the direction that minimizes the loss.

**1.2.3 Key Concepts in Deep Learning**

- **Learning Rate:** Controls the step size during weight updates.
- **Epochs:** One complete pass through the entire training dataset.
- **Batch Size:** The number of training samples processed in one iteration.
- **Overfitting:** When a model memorizes the training data and performs poorly on unseen data.
- **Regularization:** Techniques to prevent overfitting (e.g., dropout, weight decay).

**Note:**

- Understanding the fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning is crucial for grasping the more advanced concepts related to CodeBERTa and the Transformer architecture.

**Chapter 2: Understanding CodeBERTa**

**2.1 The Transformer Revolution**

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need," revolutionized natural language processing. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which process text sequentially, Transformers utilize a mechanism called **self-attention** to capture relationships between words in a sequence, regardless of their distance.

**2.1.1 Self-Attention: The Core of Transformers**

Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence when processing each word. This enables it to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships that are crucial for understanding language.

**Equation (Scaled Dot-Product Attention):**

$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$

Where:

- $Q$ (Query): A matrix representing the current word being processed.
- $K$ (Key): A matrix representing all words in the sequence.
- $V$ (Value): A matrix containing the values associated with each word.
- $d_k$: The dimension of the key vectors.

**2.2 BERT and RoBERTa: Pre-trained Language Models**

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful pre-trained language model based on the Transformer architecture. RoBERTa is an optimized version of BERT with improved training procedures.

**2.2.1 Pre-training:**

These models are pre-trained on massive text datasets using tasks like:

- **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):** Predicting masked words in a sequence.
- **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):** Predicting whether two sentences follow each other.

Pre-training allows the models to learn general-purpose language representations.

**2.2.2 Fine-tuning:**

Pre-trained models are fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks (like code classification) by adding a task-specific layer and training on a labeled dataset.

**2.3 CodeBERTa: A Model for Code Understanding**

CodeBERTa is a specialized language model pre-trained on a large corpus of programming language data. It leverages the power of RoBERTa to understand the syntax, semantics, and structure of code.

**2.3.1 Advantages of CodeBERTa for Code Classification:**

- **Code-Specific Pre-training:** Understands the nuances of programming languages.
- **Contextual Embeddings:** Generates representations of words that are influenced by their surrounding context.
- **Transformer Architecture:** Captures long-range dependencies in code.

**Disclaimer:**

- CodeBERTa's performance may vary depending on the specific programming languages and the characteristics of the code being classified.

**Note:**

- CodeBERTa represents a significant advancement in applying deep learning to code analysis, offering substantial improvements over traditional methods.

       dropout: float = 0.1
       gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 1
   ```

   - Defines hyperparameters for the model and training process.

3. **Data Loading and Preprocessing (`CodeDataset`)**
   - Handles loading and tokenizing code data.
4. **Classifier Class (`CodeBertaClassifier`)**
   - Encapsulates the CodeBERTa model, training, and evaluation logic.
5. **Main Execution (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**
   - Orchestrates the training and evaluation process.

**3.2 Model Configuration (`ModelConfig`)**

This dataclass defines the hyperparameters that control the model's architecture and the training process.

**Detailed Explanation of Hyperparameters:**

- `model_name: str = "huggingface/CodeBERTa-small-v1"`: Specifies the pre-trained CodeBERTa model to use. "huggingface/CodeBERTa-small-v1" is a smaller, faster version of CodeBERTa, suitable for experimentation and resource-constrained environments.
- `max_length: int = 512`: The maximum sequence length for input code. Code longer than 512 tokens will be truncated, while shorter code will be padded. This parameter is crucial for managing memory usage and computational efficiency. Larger values can capture more context but may require more resources.
- `batch_size: int = 16`: The number of code samples processed in each training iteration (batch). Larger batch sizes can speed up training but require more memory. The optimal batch size depends on the available hardware and the dataset's characteristics.
- `epochs: int = 3`: The number of complete passes through the training dataset. More epochs can lead to better performance, but they also increase the risk of overfitting and require more training time.
- `learning_rate: float = 2e-5`: Controls the step size during weight updates in the optimization algorithm (AdamW). A smaller learning rate leads to slower but potentially more stable learning. Fine-tuning pre-trained models often involves using smaller learning rates than training from scratch.
- `warmup_ratio: float = 0.1`: The proportion of training steps used for a learning rate warmup. During the warmup phase, the learning rate gradually increases from a small value to the target learning rate. This helps stabilize training in the early stages, preventing large weight updates that could disrupt the pre-trained weights.
- `max_grad_norm: float = 1.0`: The maximum value for gradient clipping. Gradient clipping is used to prevent the "exploding gradient" problem, where gradients become very large and destabilize training. Clipping limits the norm of the gradients to a certain threshold.
- `early_stopping_patience: int = 3`: The number of epochs to wait for improvement in validation loss before stopping training. Early stopping is a regularization technique that prevents overfitting by stopping training before the model starts to memorize the training data.
- `validation_split: float = 0.1`: The proportion of the training data used for validation. The validation set is used to monitor the model's performance on unseen data during training and to trigger early stopping.
- `freeze_base_model: bool = True`: Whether to freeze the weights of the base CodeBERTa model during training. Freezing prevents the pre-trained weights from being drastically altered, preserving the knowledge learned during pre-training. This is often beneficial when fine-tuning on smaller datasets.
- `unfreeze_last_n_layers: int = 2`: If `freeze_base_model` is True, this parameter specifies the number of layers from the top of the base model to unfreeze (make trainable). Unfreezing the top layers allows the model to adapt these layers to the specific code classification task while still leveraging the general language understanding learned during pre-training.
- `weight_decay: float = 0.01`: The strength of L2 regularization applied to the model's weights. Weight decay helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights. The AdamW optimizer, used in this script, incorporates weight decay directly into the optimization process.
- `dropout: float = 0.1`: The dropout rate used in the model's layers. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of neuron activations to zero during training, preventing the model from relying too heavily on individual neurons and promoting more robust learning.
- `gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 1`: The number of steps over which to accumulate gradients before performing an optimizer step. Gradient accumulation can be used to effectively increase the batch size when memory is limited. By accumulating gradients over multiple small batches, the model updates the weights as if it were processing a larger batch.

**Disclaimer:**

- The optimal hyperparameter values may vary depending on the dataset, the specific code classification task, and the available computational resources. Experimentation and tuning are often required to find the best settings.

**Note:**

- The `ModelConfig` class provides a convenient way to organize and manage hyperparameters, making it easier to modify and experiment with different settings.

**3.3 Data Loading and Preprocessing (`CodeDataset`)**

The `CodeDataset` class is responsible for loading code files, tokenizing them, and preparing them for input to the CodeBERTa model.

```python
class CodeDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts: List[str], labels: List[int],
                 tokenizer: RobertaTokenizer, max_length: int):
        if not texts or not labels or len(texts) != len(labels):
            raise ValueError("Invalid input data format")

        self.texts = texts
        self.labels = labels
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_length = max_length

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return len(self.texts)

    def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
        text = str(self.texts[idx])
        label = self.labels[idx]

        try:
            encoding = self.tokenizer.encode_plus(
                text,
                add_special_tokens=True,
                max_length=self.max_length,
                return_token_type_ids=False,
                padding='max_length',
                truncation=True,
                return_attention_mask=True,
                return_tensors='pt',
            )
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error tokenizing text at index {idx}: {str(e)}")
            raise

        return {
            'input_ids': encoding['input_ids'].flatten(),
            'attention_mask': encoding['attention_mask'].flatten(),
            'labels': torch.tensor(label, dtype=torch.long)
        }
```

**3.3.1 `__init__` Method:**

- Takes a list of code texts (`texts`), a list of corresponding labels (`labels`), a `RobertaTokenizer` instance (`tokenizer`), and the maximum sequence length (`max_length`) as input.
- Performs basic input validation to ensure that the `texts` and `labels` lists are not empty and have the same length.
- Initializes the dataset's attributes.

**3.3.2 `__len__` Method:**

- Returns the number of samples in the dataset (the length of the `texts` list).

**3.3.3 `__getitem__` Method (Detailed Explanation):**

This method is crucial for preparing a single code sample for the model.

- `text = str(self.texts[idx])`: Retrieves the code text at the given index `idx`.
- `label = self.labels[idx]`: Retrieves the corresponding label.
- `encoding = self.tokenizer.encode_plus(...)`: Tokenizes the code text using the `RobertaTokenizer`.

  - **`text`:** The raw code text string.
  - **`add_special_tokens=True`:** Adds special tokens like `<s>` (start of sequence) and `</s>` (end of sequence). These tokens help the model understand the structure of the input sequence.
  - **`max_length=self.max_length`:** Specifies the maximum length of the token sequence. Sequences longer than this will be truncated, and shorter sequences will be padded.
  - **`return_token_type_ids=False`:** This argument is used for tasks involving multiple sequences (e.g., sentence pair classification). Since we have a single sequence classification task, it's set to `False`.
  - **`padding='max_length'`:** Pads the sequence with a special padding token (usually `0`) to reach the specified `max_length`. Padding ensures that all input sequences have the same length, which is required for efficient batch processing.
  - **`truncation=True`:** Truncates the sequence if it exceeds `max_length`. Truncation is necessary to handle sequences that are longer than the model's maximum input length.
  - **`return_attention_mask=True`:** Returns an attention mask, which is a binary sequence of the same length as the input sequence. It has `1`s for real tokens and `0`s for padding tokens. The attention mask helps the model focus on the relevant parts of the input and ignore the padding.
  - **`return_tensors='pt'`:** Returns the results as PyTorch tensors.

- `return { ... }`: Returns a dictionary containing:

  - **`'input_ids'`:** A flattened tensor containing the numerical IDs of the tokens in the encoded sequence.
  - **`'attention_mask'`:** A flattened tensor representing the attention mask.
  - **`'labels'`:** A tensor containing the numerical label of the code's programming language.

**Diagram (Tokenization Process):**

```

**Disclaimer:**

- The specific tokenization scheme used by the `RobertaTokenizer` may vary slightly depending on the pre-trained model and the version of the `transformers` library.

**Note:**

- The `CodeDataset` class effectively transforms raw code data into a numerical format that can be processed by the CodeBERTa model, handling essential tasks like tokenization, padding, and attention mask creation.

**3.4 The Classifier (`CodeBertaClassifier`)**

This class encapsulates the CodeBERTa model, the training logic, and the evaluation logic.

**3.4.1 Initialization (`__init__`)**

```python
class CodeBertaClassifier:
    def __init__(self, config: ModelConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
        logger.info(f"Using device: {self.device}")

        try:
            self.tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained(config.model_name)
            self.model = RobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
                config.model_name,
                num_labels=len(self.get_language_mapping()),
                hidden_dropout_prob=config.dropout,
                attention_probs_dropout_prob=config.dropout
            )
            self.model.to(self.device)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error loading model: {str(e)}")
            raise

        self._setup_model_parameters()
        logger.info(f"Model initialized with config: {config}")
```

- `self.config = config`: Stores the model configuration.

- `self.model = RobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(...)`: Loads the pre-trained `RobertaForSequenceClassification` model.

  - `config.model_name`: The name of the pre-trained CodeBERTa model.
  - `num_labels=len(self.get_language_mapping())`: Specifies the number of output classes (programming languages), which is determined by the length of the dictionary returned by `get_language_mapping()`.

- `self.model.to(self.device)`: Moves the model to the selected device (GPU or CPU).
- `self._setup_model_parameters()`: Calls a method to freeze or unfreeze layers based on the configuration.

**3.4.2 Model Parameter Setup (`_setup_model_parameters`)**

```python
    def _setup_model_parameters(self):
        """Configure model parameters freezing/unfreezing"""
        if self.config.freeze_base_model:
            for param in self.model.roberta.parameters():
                param.requires_grad = False

            if self.config.unfreeze_last_n_layers > 0:
                for layer in self.model.roberta.encoder.layer[-self.config.unfreeze_last_n_layers:]:
                    for param in layer.parameters():
                        param.requires_grad = True

        for param in self.model.classifier.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = True

        # Log trainable parameters
        trainable_params = sum(p.numel() for p in self.model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)
        total_params = sum(p.numel() for p in self.model.parameters())
        logger.info(f"Trainable parameters: {trainable_params:,d} ({100 * trainable_params / total_params:.2f}%)")
```

This method configures which model parameters are trainable and which are frozen.

- `if self.config.freeze_base_model:`: Checks if the base CodeBERTa model should be frozen.

  - `for param in self.model.roberta.parameters(): param.requires_grad = False`: If `freeze_base_model` is True, it iterates through all the parameters in the `model.roberta` part (the base CodeBERTa model) and sets `requires_grad` to `False`. This freezes these parameters, preventing their weights from being updated during training.
  - `if self.config.unfreeze_last_n_layers > 0:`: Checks if a certain number of layers from the top should be unfrozen.
    - `for layer in self.model.roberta.encoder.layer[-self.config.unfreeze_last_n_layers:]:`: Iterates through the last `unfreeze_last_n_layers` layers of the encoder.
    - `for param in layer.parameters(): param.requires_grad = True`: Sets `requires_grad` to `True` for all parameters in these layers, making them trainable.

- `for param in self.model.classifier.parameters(): param.requires_grad = True`: Ensures that the parameters of the final classification layer (`model.classifier`) are always trainable.

**3.4.3 Language Mapping (`get_language_mapping`)**

```python
    @staticmethod
    def get_language_mapping() -> Dict[str, int]:
        return {
            'cpp': 0, 'groovy': 1, 'java': 2, 'javascript': 3,
            'json': 4, 'python': 5, 'xml': 6, 'yml': 7
        }
```

- Defines a static method that returns a dictionary mapping programming language names (strings) to numerical indices (integers). This mapping is used to convert string labels into numerical representations that the model can process.

**3.4.4 Data Preparation (`prepare_data`)**

```python
    def prepare_data(self, data_dir):
        """Original data loading method kept as is"""
        texts = []
        labels = []
        file_counts = {lang: 0 for lang in self.get_language_mapping().keys()}

        for lang_path in Path(data_dir).glob('*'):
            if lang_path.is_dir():
                lang = lang_path.name
                if lang in self.get_language_mapping():
                    for file_path in lang_path.glob('*'):
                        try:
                            text = file_path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
                            texts.append(text)
                            labels.append(self.get_language_mapping()[lang])
                            file_counts[lang] += 1
                        except UnicodeDecodeError:
                            continue

        logger.info("\nFiles processed per language:")
        for lang, count in file_counts.items():
            logger.info(f"{lang}: {count} files")

        return texts, labels
```

This method loads the code data from a directory.

- `texts = []`: Initializes an empty list to store the code text from each file.
- `labels = []`: Initializes an empty list to store the corresponding programming language labels.
- `file_counts = {lang: 0 for lang in self.get_language_mapping().keys()}`: Initializes a dictionary to count the number of files processed for each language.
- `for lang_path in Path(data_dir).glob('*'):`: Iterates through all files and subdirectories in the `data_dir`.
  - `if lang_path.is_dir():`: Checks if the current item is a directory.
    - `lang = lang_path.name`: Extracts the directory name, which represents the programming language.
    - `if lang in self.get_language_mapping():`: Checks if the language is in the supported languages.
      - `for file_path in lang_path.glob('*'):`: Iterates through all files within the language subdirectory.
        - `try...except UnicodeDecodeError`: Attempts to read the file content as UTF-8 text. If a `UnicodeDecodeError` occurs (meaning the file is not valid UTF-8), it skips the file.

**3.4.5 Training One Epoch (`train_epoch`)**

```python
    def train_epoch(self, train_loader: DataLoader, optimizer: AdamW,
                   scheduler: Optional[torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler],
                   scaler: GradScaler, epoch: int) -> float:
        self.model.train()

            # Move batch to device
            batch = {k: v.to(self.device) for k, v in batch.items()}

            total_correct += (predictions == batch['labels']).sum().item()
            total_samples += len(batch['labels'])

            # Log progress
            if batch_idx % 50 == 0:
                elapsed = time.time() - start_time
                logger.info(
                    f'Epoch {epoch+1} | Batch {batch_idx}/{len(train_loader)} | '
                    f'Loss: {loss.item():.4f} | '

This method trains the model for a single epoch.

- `self.model.train()`: Sets the model to training mode (enables dropout and batch normalization if used).
- `total_loss = 0`, `total_correct = 0`, `total_samples = 0`: Initializes variables to track loss, correct predictions, and the number of samples.
- `start_time = time.time()`: Records the start time for performance monitoring.
- `for batch_idx, batch in enumerate(train_loader):`: Iterates through the training data in batches using the `train_loader`.

  - `batch = {k: v.to(self.device) for k, v in batch.items()}`: Moves the batch data (input IDs, attention mask, labels) to the selected device (GPU or CPU).
  - `with autocast():`: Enables automatic mixed precision (AMP) for faster training on GPUs that support it. AMP uses a mix of FP16 (16-bit floating-point) and FP32 (32-bit floating-point) precision to speed up computation while maintaining accuracy.
    - `outputs = self.model(**batch)`: Performs the forward pass. The `**batch` unpacks the dictionary containing input IDs, attention mask, and labels, passing them as keyword arguments to the model. The model returns a `SequenceClassifierOutput` object that contains the loss, logits, and potentially other information.
    - `loss = outputs.loss / self.config.gradient_accumulation_steps`: Retrieves the loss from the model's output and divides it by `gradient_accumulation_steps`.
  - `scaler.scale(loss).backward()`: Calculates the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's parameters. The `scaler` is used in conjunction with AMP to scale the loss and prevent underflow when using FP16 precision.
  - `if (batch_idx + 1) % self.config.gradient_accumulation_steps == 0:`: Checks if it's time to perform an optimizer step based on the number of gradient accumulation steps.

    - `scaler.unscale_(optimizer)`: Unscales the gradients before clipping.
    - `clip_grad_norm_(self.model.parameters(), self.config.max_grad_norm)`: Clips the norm of the gradients to the specified `max_grad_norm` to prevent exploding gradients.

      **Equation (Gradient Norm Clipping):**

      If the L2 norm of the gradients (||g||) exceeds `max_grad_norm`, the gradients are scaled down:

      $g' = \frac{g \cdot \text{max\_grad\_norm}}{||g||}$

      Where:

      - $g$ is the original gradient vector.
      - $g'$ is the clipped gradient vector.
      - $||g||$ is the L2 norm of the gradient vector.

    - `scaler.step(optimizer)`: Updates the model's weights using the optimizer (AdamW) and the scaled gradients.
    - `scaler.update()`: Updates the gradient scaler for the next iteration.
    - `optimizer.zero_grad()`: Resets the gradients to zero before the next backward pass.
    - `if scheduler: scheduler.step()`: Updates the learning rate scheduler (if provided).

  - `total_loss += loss.item() * self.config.gradient_accumulation_steps`, `total_correct += ...`, `total_samples += ...`: Updates the running totals for loss, correct predictions, and the number of samples.
