**Chapter 1: Introduction to Deep Learning and Text Classification**

**1.1 Deep Learning: A Paradigm Shift**

Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, has emerged as a transformative force in artificial intelligence. Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, deep learning models, particularly artificial neural networks, excel at learning complex patterns and representations from vast amounts of data. This capability has led to breakthroughs in various domains, including image recognition, natural language processing, and, as we will explore, code analysis.

**Note:** Deep learning models are characterized by their "depth" – the use of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that learn hierarchical representations of data. This depth allows them to capture intricate relationships and patterns that might be missed by shallower models.

**1.2 Text Classification: Categorizing the Written Word**

Text classification, a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), involves assigning predefined categories or labels to textual data. This seemingly simple task has wide-ranging applications, such as:

- **Spam Filtering:** Identifying unwanted emails.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the emotional tone of a text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
- **Topic Modeling:** Discovering the underlying themes in a collection of documents.
- **Language Identification:** Determining the language of a given text.
- **Code Classification:** The focus of this book – assigning programming language labels to code files.

**1.3 Deep Learning for Text Classification**

Deep learning has revolutionized text classification by offering powerful techniques to automatically learn meaningful representations from text. Traditional approaches often relied on manual feature engineering, which can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may not capture the full complexity of language. Deep learning models, on the other hand, can automatically learn relevant features from raw text, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency.

**1.4 Neural Network Architectures for Text**

Several neural network architectures have proven effective for text classification:

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Particularly LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units), are well-suited for processing sequential data like text. They maintain a "memory" of previous words in a sequence, allowing them to capture context.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** While traditionally used for image processing, CNNs have also shown promise in text classification. They can learn local patterns and features from text by applying filters that slide across the input sequence.
- **Transformer Networks:** The architecture behind CodeBERTa, Transformers, have revolutionized NLP with their self-attention mechanism, which allows them to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence and capture long-range dependencies.

**Note:** The choice of architecture depends on the specific task and dataset. Transformers have become the dominant architecture for many NLP tasks due to their ability to handle long sequences and capture complex relationships within text.

**Chapter 2: Understanding CodeBERTa**

**2.1 The Rise of Transformer Models**

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need," marked a paradigm shift in NLP. Unlike RNNs, which process text sequentially, Transformers process the entire input sequence in parallel, thanks to their self-attention mechanism. This parallelism allows for faster training and better handling of long-range dependencies.

**2.2 BERT and RoBERTa: Foundational Language Models**

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) built upon the Transformer architecture and demonstrated remarkable performance on various NLP tasks. RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) further improved upon BERT by optimizing the pre-training procedure, leading to even better results.

**2.3 CodeBERTa: Tailored for Code Understanding**

CodeBERTa extends the RoBERTa architecture and specializes it for understanding programming languages. It's pre-trained on a massive dataset of code, allowing it to learn the syntax, semantics, and nuances of various programming languages.

**Disclaimer:**

While CodeBERTa is a powerful model for code understanding, it's not a silver bullet. Its performance can be affected by factors like the quality and quantity of training data, the choice of hyperparameters, and the specific characteristics of the code being analyzed.

**2.4 Pre-training and Fine-tuning: A Two-Step Process**

CodeBERTa, like many modern language models, follows a two-step training process:

1. **Pre-training:** The model is trained on a large corpus of unlabeled code using self-supervised learning objectives like:

   - **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):** Predicting randomly masked words in a code snippet.
   - **Next Token Prediction (NTP):** Predicting the next logical token that comes after the code snippet.

   This pre-training phase allows the model to learn general-purpose representations of programming languages.

2. **Fine-tuning:** The pre-trained model is adapted to a specific downstream task, such as code classification. A classification layer is added on top of the pre-trained model, and the entire network is trained on a labeled dataset of code files and their corresponding programming languages.

**Note:** Pre-training is computationally expensive, but it allows the model to learn rich representations of code that can be effectively transferred to various downstream tasks. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, is typically much faster and requires less data.

**2.5 Advantages of Using CodeBERTa for Code Classification**

CodeBERTa offers several advantages for code classification:

- **Code-Specific Pre-training:** It's pre-trained on code, giving it a significant advantage over models pre-trained only on natural language text.
- **Contextual Embeddings:** It generates contextualized word embeddings, meaning that the representation of a word is influenced by its surrounding words. This is crucial for understanding code, where the meaning of a keyword or variable can depend heavily on its context.
- **Self-Attention Mechanism:** The Transformer architecture's self-attention mechanism allows CodeBERTa to capture long-range dependencies in code, enabling it to understand complex code structures and relationships between different parts of a code file.
- **Transfer Learning:** The pre-trained knowledge learned by CodeBERTa can be effectively transferred to the code classification task, reducing the amount of labeled data required for fine-tuning and improving performance.

**Chapter 3: Diving into the Code: `CodeBERTaV2.py`**

Now, let's embark on a detailed journey through the provided Python code, `CodeBERTaV2.py`. We'll dissect each section, explaining its purpose, functionality, and the underlying concepts.

**3.1 Initial Setup and Imports**

The script begins by importing necessary libraries:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler
from transformers import (
    RobertaTokenizer,
    RobertaForSequenceClassification,
    AdamW,
    get_linear_schedule_with_warmup
)
from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import logging
import json
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Optional
import torch.nn.functional as F
from dataclasses import dataclass
from torch.nn.utils import clip_grad_norm_
import time
from datetime import datetime
```

**Explanation:**

- **`torch`:** The core PyTorch library for deep learning.
- **`torch.utils.data`:** Provides `Dataset` and `DataLoader` for efficient data handling.
- **`torch.cuda.amp`:** Enables automatic mixed precision (AMP) for faster training.

- **`torch.nn.utils`:** Offers utility functions like `clip_grad_norm_` for gradient clipping.
- **`time` and `datetime`**: For recording time.

**Note:** The use of these libraries demonstrates a well-structured approach to deep learning, leveraging established tools and best practices for efficient and robust model development.

**3.2 Logging Configuration**

```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler(f'training_{datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")}.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

**Explanation:**

- `logging.basicConfig(...)`: Configures the logging system.
- `level=logging.INFO`: Sets the logging level to INFO, meaning that messages of level INFO and above (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be logged.
- `format`: Specifies the format of the log messages, including timestamp, log level, and message.
- `handlers`: Defines where the log messages will be sent. Here, it's configured to log to both a file (with a timestamp in the filename) and the console (StreamHandler).
- `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`: Gets a logger instance with the name of the current module.

**Note:** Proper logging is crucial for monitoring the training process, debugging, and recording experimental results. The use of timestamps in the log file names is a good practice for tracking different training runs.

**3.3 Model Configuration (`ModelConfig`)**

```python
@dataclass
class ModelConfig:
    """Configuration for model training and evaluation"""
    model_name: str = "huggingface/CodeBERTa-small-v1"
    max_length: int = 512
    batch_size: int = 16
    epochs: int = 3
    learning_rate: float = 2e-5
    warmup_ratio: float = 0.1
    max_grad_norm: float = 1.0
    early_stopping_patience: int = 3
    validation_split: float = 0.1
    freeze_base_model: bool = True
    unfreeze_last_n_layers: int = 2
    weight_decay: float = 0.01
    dropout: float = 0.1
    gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 1
```

**Explanation:**

- The `ModelConfig` dataclass defines the hyperparameters for the model and training process.
- Each field has a default value and a type hint.
- Here's a detailed explanation of each field as well as their types:
  - `model_name: str`: The name of the pre-trained CodeBERTa model from the Hugging Face model hub. Using `"huggingface/CodeBERTa-small-v1"`.
  - `max_length: int`: The maximum sequence length for input code (512 tokens).
  - `batch_size: int`: The number of samples processed in each training iteration (16).
  - `epochs: int`: The number of passes through the entire training dataset (3).
  - `learning_rate: float`: The initial learning rate for the optimizer (2e-5).
  - `warmup_ratio: float`: The proportion of training steps used for a learning rate warmup (0.1).
  - `max_grad_norm: float`: The maximum norm for gradient clipping (1.0).
  - `early_stopping_patience: int`: The number of epochs to wait for an improvement in validation loss before stopping training (3).
  - `validation_split: float`: The proportion of the training data used for validation (0.1).
  - `freeze_base_model: bool`: Whether to freeze the weights of the base CodeBERTa model (True).
  - `unfreeze_last_n_layers: int`: The number of layers from the top of the base model to unfreeze (2).
  - `weight_decay: float`: The weight decay (L2 regularization) for the optimizer (0.01).
  - `dropout: float`: The dropout probability for regularization (0.1).
  - `gradient_accumulation_steps: int`: The number of steps to accumulate gradients before performing an update (1).

**Disclaimer:**

The choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the model's performance. The default values provided here are a starting point, but they may not be optimal for all datasets and tasks. Thorough hyperparameter tuning is often required to achieve the best results.

**Note:** The `ModelConfig` class provides a clear and organized way to manage the model's hyperparameters. Using a dataclass makes it easy to create, modify, and access these parameters.

**3.4 Data Loading and Preprocessing (`CodeDataset`)**

```python
class CodeDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts: List[str], labels: List[int],
                 tokenizer: RobertaTokenizer, max_length: int):
        if not texts or not labels or len(texts) != len(labels):
            raise ValueError("Invalid input data format")

        self.texts = texts
        self.labels = labels
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_length = max_length

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return len(self.texts)

    def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
        text = str(self.texts[idx])
        label = self.labels[idx]

        try:
            encoding = self.tokenizer.encode_plus(
                text,
                add_special_tokens=True,
                max_length=self.max_length,
                return_token_type_ids=False,
                padding='max_length',
                truncation=True,
                return_attention_mask=True,
                return_tensors='pt',
            )
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error tokenizing text at index {idx}: {str(e)}")
            raise

        return {
            'input_ids': encoding['input_ids'].flatten(),
            'attention_mask': encoding['attention_mask'].flatten(),
            'labels': torch.tensor(label, dtype=torch.long)
        }
```

**Explanation:**

- The `CodeDataset` class is a custom PyTorch `Dataset` that handles loading and preprocessing the code data.
- `__init__`:
  - Takes lists of code texts (`texts`) and their corresponding labels (`labels`), a `RobertaTokenizer` instance, and the `max_length` as input.
  - Performs basic input validation to ensure that the texts and labels are not empty and have the same length.
- `__len__`: Returns the number of samples in the dataset.
- `__getitem__`:
  - This method is called by the `DataLoader` to retrieve a single sample from the dataset.
  - It takes an index (`idx`) as input and returns a dictionary containing the input IDs, attention mask, and label for the corresponding code sample.
  - `text = str(self.texts[idx])`: Retrieves the code text at the given index.
  - `label = self.labels[idx]`: Retrieves the corresponding label.
  - `encoding = self.tokenizer.encode_plus(...)`: Tokenizes the code text using the provided tokenizer. The `encode_plus` method performs the following:
    - `add_special_tokens=True`: Adds special tokens like `<s>` (start of sequence) and `</s>` (end of sequence).
    - `max_length=self.max_length`: Pads or truncates the sequence to the specified `max_length`.
    - `return_token_type_ids=False`: We don't need token type IDs for this task (they are used for tasks involving multiple sequences).
    - `padding='max_length'`: Pads the sequence with the padding token to reach `max_length`.
    - `truncation=True`: Truncates the sequence if it exceeds `max_length`.
    - `return_attention_mask=True`: Returns an attention mask indicating which tokens are real and which are padding.
    - `return_tensors='pt'`: Returns the results as PyTorch tensors.
  - The method returns a dictionary containing:
    - `'input_ids'`: A flattened tensor of token IDs.
    - `'attention_mask'`: A flattened tensor representing the attention mask.
    - `'labels'`: A tensor containing the numerical label.

**Note:** The `CodeDataset` class is a crucial component of the data pipeline. It efficiently handles the conversion of raw code text into a numerical format that can be processed by the CodeBERTa model. The use of a custom `Dataset` allows for flexibility in handling different data formats and preprocessing requirements.

**3.5 The Classifier (`CodeBertaClassifier`)**

The `CodeBertaClassifier` class encapsulates the CodeBERTa model, training, and evaluation logic. Let's break down its methods:

**3.5.1 Initialization (`__init__`)**

```python
class CodeBertaClassifier:
    def __init__(self, config: ModelConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
        logger.info(f"Using device: {self.device}")

        try:
            self.tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained(config.model_name)
            self.model = RobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
                config.model_name,
                num_labels=len(self.get_language_mapping()),
                hidden_dropout_prob=config.dropout,
                attention_probs_dropout_prob=config.dropout
            )
            self.model.to(self.device)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error loading model: {str(e)}")
            raise

        self._setup_model_parameters()
        logger.info(f"Model initialized with config: {config}")
```

**Explanation:**

- `self.config = config`: Stores the `ModelConfig` instance.
- `self.device = torch.device(...)`: Determines whether to use a GPU (CUDA) if available, otherwise defaults to the CPU.
- `self.tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained(config.model_name)`: Loads the pre-trained tokenizer associated with the specified CodeBERTa model.
- `self.model = RobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(...)`: Loads the pre-trained CodeBERTa model for sequence classification.
  - `num_labels=len(self.get_language_mapping())`: Sets the number of output classes (programming languages) based on the `get_language_mapping` method (which we'll see later).
  - `hidden_dropout_prob=config.dropout`: Sets the dropout probability for the hidden layers.
  - `attention_probs_dropout_prob=config.dropout`: Sets the dropout probability for the attention probabilities.
- `self.model.to(self.device)`: Moves the model to the selected device (GPU or CPU).
- `self._setup_model_parameters()`: Calls a helper method to configure which model parameters are trainable (freezing/unfreezing).

**Note:** The initialization process demonstrates the ease of use of the Hugging Face Transformers library. With just a few lines of code, we can load a pre-trained tokenizer and model, ready for fine-tuning.

**3.5.2 Model Parameter Setup (`_setup_model_parameters`)**

```python
    def _setup_model_parameters(self):
        """Configure model parameters freezing/unfreezing"""
        if self.config.freeze_base_model:
            for param in self.model.roberta.parameters():
                param.requires_grad = False

            if self.config.unfreeze_last_n_layers > 0:
                for layer in self.model.roberta.encoder.layer[-self.config.unfreeze_last_n_layers:]:
                    for param in layer.parameters():
                        param.requires_grad = True

        for param in self.model.classifier.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = True

        # Log trainable parameters
        trainable_params = sum(p.numel() for p in self.model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)
        total_params = sum(p.numel() for p in self.model.parameters())
        logger.info(f"Trainable parameters: {trainable_params:,d} ({100 * trainable_params / total_params:.2f}%)")
```

**Explanation:**

- This method controls which parts of the model will be trained (fine-tuned) and which will be frozen.
- `if self.config.freeze_base_model:`: If `freeze_base_model` is True in the `ModelConfig`, the parameters of the base CodeBERTa model (`self.model.roberta`) are frozen by setting `param.requires_grad = False`.
  - `if self.config.unfreeze_last_n_layers > 0:`: If `unfreeze_last_n_layers` is greater than 0, the last `n` layers of the base model are unfrozen by setting `param.requires_grad = True`. This allows the model to adapt the higher-level representations to the specific task.
- `for param in self.model.classifier.parameters(): param.requires_grad = True`: The parameters of the classification layer (`self.model.classifier`) are always made trainable.
- The code then logs the number of trainable parameters and their percentage of the total parameters.

**Note:** The strategy of freezing the base model and unfreezing only the top layers is a common and effective technique for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. It helps to prevent overfitting, especially when the fine-tuning dataset is small, and allows the model to leverage the knowledge learned during pre-training.

**Disclaimer:** The optimal number of layers to unfreeze depends on the specific task and dataset. Experimentation may be required to find the best setting.

**3.5.3 Language Mapping (`get_language_mapping`)**

```python
    @staticmethod
    def get_language_mapping() -> Dict[str, int]:
        return {
            'cpp': 0, 'groovy': 1, 'java': 2, 'javascript': 3,
            'json': 4, 'python': 5, 'xml': 6, 'yml': 7
        }
```

**Explanation:**

- This static method defines a mapping between programming language names (strings) and numerical indices (integers).
- This mapping is used to convert the string labels in the dataset into numerical labels that the model can process.

**Note:** The order of the languages in this mapping determines the index assigned to each language. This order should be consistent throughout the code, particularly when interpreting the model's output and evaluating performance.

**3.5.4 Data Preparation (`prepare_data`)**

```python
    def prepare_data(self, data_dir):
        """Original data loading method kept as is"""
        texts = []
        labels = []
        file_counts = {lang: 0 for lang in self.get_language_mapping().keys()}

        for lang_path in Path(data_dir).glob('*'):
            if lang_path.is_dir():
                lang = lang_path.name
                if lang in self.get_language_mapping():
                    for file_path in lang_path.glob('*'):
                        try:
                            text = file_path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
                            texts.append(text)
                            labels.append(self.get_language_mapping()[lang])
                            file_counts[lang] += 1
                        except UnicodeDecodeError:
                            continue

        logger.info("\nFiles processed per language:")
        for lang, count in file_counts.items():
            logger.info(f"{lang}: {count} files")

        return texts, labels
```

**Explanation:**

- This method loads the code data from a directory (`data_dir`).
- It expects the directory to have subdirectories for each programming language, with each subdirectory containing code files of that language.
- `texts = []`: Initializes an empty list to store the code texts.
- `labels = []`: Initializes an empty list to store the corresponding labels.
- `file_counts = {lang: 0 for lang in self.get_language_mapping().keys()}`: Initializes a dictionary to count the number of files processed for each language.
- The code then iterates through the subdirectories in `data_dir`:
  - `if lang_path.is_dir():`: Checks if the path is a directory.
  - `lang = lang_path.name`: Gets the name of the subdirectory (which represents the programming language).
  - `if lang in self.get_language_mapping():`: Checks if the language is in the defined mapping.
  - It then iterates through the files in each language subdirectory:
    - `try...except UnicodeDecodeError`: Attempts to read the file content as UTF-8 text. If a `UnicodeDecodeError` occurs (meaning the file is not valid UTF-8), it skips the file.
    - `text = file_path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')`: Reads the file content.
    - `texts.append(text)`: Appends the code text to the `texts` list.
    - `labels.append(self.get_language_mapping()[lang])`: Appends the corresponding numerical label to the `labels` list.
    - `file_counts[lang] += 1`: Increments the file count for the language.
- Finally, it logs the number of files processed for each language and returns the `texts` and `labels` lists.

**Note:** This method assumes a specific directory structure for the data. It's important to ensure that the data is organized correctly for this method to work as intended. The error handling for `UnicodeDecodeError` is a good practice, as it prevents the code from crashing when encountering non-text files or files with invalid encodings.

**Disclaimer:**

The data loading and preprocessing steps can significantly impact the model's performance. It's crucial to ensure that the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and formatted correctly. This method could be improved by adding more robust error handling, data cleaning, and potentially data augmentation techniques.

**3.5.5 Training One Epoch (`train_epoch`)**

```python
    def train_epoch(self, train_loader: DataLoader, optimizer: AdamW,
                   scheduler: Optional[torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler],
                   scaler: GradScaler, epoch: int) -> float:
        self.model.train()
        total_loss = 0
        total_correct = 0
        total_samples = 0

**Explanation:**

- `self.model.train()`: Sets the model to training mode (activates dropout, batch normalization, etc.).
- `total_loss = 0`, `total_correct = 0`, `total_samples = 0`: Initializes variables to track loss, correct predictions, and the number of samples.
- The code then iterates through the `train_loader`, which provides batches of training data:
  - `batch = {k: v.to(self.device) for k, v in batch.items()}`: Moves the batch to the selected device (GPU or CPU).
  - `with autocast():`: Enables automatic mixed precision (AMP) for faster training on GPUs that support it.
    - `outputs = self.model(**batch)`: Performs a forward pass through the model. The `**batch` unpacks the dictionary containing input IDs, attention mask, and labels.
    - `loss = outputs.loss / self.config.gradient_accumulation_steps`: Calculates the loss and divides it by `gradient_accumulation_steps` to average the loss over multiple batches.
  - `scaler.scale(loss).backward()`: Performs a backward pass to calculate the gradients, scaling the loss for AMP.
  - `if (batch_idx + 1) % self.config.gradient_accumulation_steps == 0:`: Checks if it's time to perform an optimizer step (after accumulating gradients for the specified number of steps).
    - `scaler.unscale_(optimizer)`: Unscales the gradients before clipping.
    - `clip_grad_norm_(...)`: Clips the gradient norm to prevent exploding gradients.
    - `scaler.step(optimizer)`: Updates the model's weights using the optimizer.
    - `scaler.update()`: Updates the gradient scaler.
    - `optimizer.zero_grad()`: Resets the gradients to zero.
    - `if scheduler: scheduler.step()`: Updates the learning rate scheduler (if provided).
  - `total_loss += loss.item() * self.config.gradient_accumulation_steps`: Accumulates the loss.
  - `predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)`: Gets the predicted class labels.
  - `total_correct += (predictions == batch['labels']).sum().item()`: Counts the number of correct predictions.
  - `total_samples += len(batch['labels'])`: Accumulates the number of samples.
  - `if batch_idx % 50 == 0:`: Logs the training progress every 50 batches.
- After iterating through all batches, the code calculates the average loss and accuracy for the epoch and logs them.
- `return avg_loss`: Returns the average loss for the epoch.

**Note:** This method demonstrates a typical PyTorch training loop. It includes important techniques like gradient accumulation, gradient clipping, and learning rate scheduling, which contribute to stable and efficient training. The use of `autocast` and `GradScaler` enables mixed precision training, which can significantly speed up training on compatible hardware.

**Disclaimer:**

The training process can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters and the specific characteristics of the dataset. Careful monitoring of the training and validation loss is crucial to identify potential issues like overfitting or underfitting.

**3.5.6 Validation (`validate`)**

```python
    def validate(self, val_loader: DataLoader) -> Tuple[float, float]:
        self.model.eval()
        total_loss = 0
        total_correct = 0
        total_samples = 0

        with torch.no_grad():
            for batch in val_loader:
                batch = {k: v.to(self.device) for k, v in batch.items()}
                outputs = self.model(**batch)

                total_loss += outputs.loss.item()
                predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
                total_correct += (predictions == batch['labels']).sum().item()
                total_samples += len(batch['labels'])

        avg_loss = total_loss / len(val_loader)
        accuracy = total_correct / total_samples
        logger.info(f'Validation | Loss: {avg_loss:.4f} | Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}')

        return avg_loss, accuracy
```

**Explanation:**

- `self.model.eval()`: Sets the model to evaluation mode (deactivates dropout, etc.).
- `total_loss = 0`, `total_correct = 0`, `total_samples = 0`: Initializes variables to track loss, correct predictions, and the number of samples.
- `with torch.no_grad()`: Disables gradient calculations, as they are not needed during validation.
- The code iterates through the `val_loader`, which provides batches of validation data:
  - `batch = {k: v.to(self.device) for k, v in batch.items()}`: Moves the batch to the selected device.
  - `outputs = self.model(**batch)`: Performs a forward pass through the model.
  - `total_loss += outputs.loss.item()`: Accumulates the loss.
  - `predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)`: Gets the predicted
